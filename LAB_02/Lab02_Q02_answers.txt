1.) if increase the hidden nodes around 4-10 accuracy is going to high and after that if increase the hidden nodes
around 20 or higher than 20 accuracy going little bit lower

2.)
*   With very few hidden nodes (1–2), the model can’t capture the complex patterns → low accuracy.
*   With a moderate number of hidden nodes (4–10), the model learns the circular boundary well → high accuracy.

*   With too many hidden nodes (20–50), the model becomes very flexible, fits the training data almost perfectly, but may overfit (decision boundary looks very wiggly).
